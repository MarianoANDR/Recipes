        <h2>Grandma's Best Ever Sour Cream Lasagna</h2>
        <p>This is my grandma's best lasagna recipe, except I use sour cream instead of ricotta (a trick I picked up from my mother-in-law). She always made it for birthdays and special occasions. This makes a large amount, so I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. It's very cheesy, so sometimes I add a little extra tomato sauce.</p>

../images/lasagna.jpg: This path moves up one directory level (to the parent directory) and then accesses the images folder to find lasagna.jpg.

./images/lasagna.jpg: The ./ indicates the current directory. This path accesses the images folder within the current directory to find lasagna.jpg.

/images/lasagna.jpg: This is an absolute path, starting from the root directory of the file system. It accesses the images folder directly at that root level, regardless of the current working directory.

images/lasagna.jpg: This is a relative path. It assumes the images folder is located in the current directory. If you're in the correct directory, it will find lasagna.jpg there. -->


<!--

../ goes up a level,

./ indicates the current directory,

/ starts from the root,

and no prefix means it's relative to the current directory.
